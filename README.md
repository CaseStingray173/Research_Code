# MST and Steiner Tree Visualization
This repository contains the code and resources for visualizing Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) and Steiner Trees. The project focuses on plotting and visualizing MSTs and Steiner Trees using Python and the matplotlib library. The goal is to generate clear and informative graphs that represent the connections between coordinates in 2D space.
